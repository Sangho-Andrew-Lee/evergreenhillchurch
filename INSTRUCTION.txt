Step 1:
Unzip the file to your website directory in your server or host

For example, if you have /var/www/www.example.com, then you should see the following files and folders in that directory:

app/
lib/
plugins/
vendors/
...
index.php
...

Step 2:
Make sure your app/tmp/ directory and its sub-directories are all writeable

For example, in Ubuntu:
chmod -R 777 tmp/
chown -R :www-data tmp/

Step 3:
Go to Yummly API to register a free account (or paid account of your preference) in order to obtain an API ID and API key

Step 4:
- Go to app/Config/bootstrap.php
- Edit the values in the "Custom Configurations" code block to your reference (remember to add the API ID and API key from step 3 above to this "api" array)

Step 5:
If you use virtual host, then point it to app/webroot/ directory, and restart Apache

For example, in Ubuntu:

ServerName www.example.com
DocumentRoot "/var/www/www.example.com/app/webroot"
